        <h2>Nutritional value</h2>
        <p>The amounts of various nutrients in mustard seed are to be found in the USDA National Nutrient Database.[22] As a condiment, mustard averages about 5 kcal per teaspoon.[21] Some of the many vitamins and nutrients found in mustard seeds are selenium and omega 3 fatty acid.[23]</p>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>The many varieties of prepared mustards have a wide range of strengths and flavors, depending on the variety of mustard seed and the preparation method. The basic taste and "heat" of the mustard are determined largely by seed type, preparation, and ingredients.[24][25] Preparations from the white mustard plant (<span>Sinapis alba</span>) have a less pungent flavor than preparations of black mustard (<span>Brassica nigra</span>) or brown Indian mustard (<span>Brassica juncea</span>). The temperature of the water and concentration of acids such as vinegar also determine the strength of a prepared mustard; hotter liquids and stronger acids denature the enzymes that make the strength-producing compounds. Thus, "hot" mustard is made with cold water, whereas using hot water produces a milder condiment, all else being equal.[26]</p>

        <p>Mustard oil can be extracted from the chaff and meal of the seed.</p>

        <h2>Flavors</h2>
        <p>The mustard plant ingredient itself has a sharp, hot, pungent flavor.</p>
        <p>Mixing ground mustard seeds with water causes a chemical reaction between two compounds in the seed: the enzyme myrosinase and various glucosinolates such as sinigrin, myrosin, and sinalbin. The myrosinase enzyme turns the glucosinolates into various isothiocyanate compounds known generally as mustard oil. The concentrations of different glucosinolates in mustard plant varieties, and the different isothiocyanates that are produced, make different flavors and intensities.</p>
